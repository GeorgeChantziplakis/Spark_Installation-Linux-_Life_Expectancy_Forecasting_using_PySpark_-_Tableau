# Spark_Installation-Linux-_Life_Expectancy_Forecasting_using_PySpark_-_Tableau
Academic Project

Working in Linux, Ubuntu environment I created a forecast model for predicting the life expectancy of developed and undeveloped countries based on an open dataset collected from Kaggle. After the exploration and cleaning of the data Linear Regression were performed and resulted in a model giving 96% accuracy. For my coding, I used Hadoop and Spark (API used: PySpark) and all my visuals had been captured in Tableau.
